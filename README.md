# ISI-Project---Agency-s-Spending-During-And-AfterCOVID.
Our project analyzes how NYC public departments adapted and allocated resources during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to understand how much money was spent, how funds were distributed, and what financial challenges agencies faced while maintaining essential services.
